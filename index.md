Some examples of research:

- We have extended the classic SEIR model to incorporate probailistic framework to in details model contact tracing. The new model SEIR-TTI allows different test-trace-isolate strategies to be explored. The methodological paper is currently under review at PLoS Comp Biol with a preprint availble here [PTTI Model](https://covidtti.com/)
- Together with collaborators at the [Institute for Disease Modelling](https://idmod.org/tools) we developed the [Covasim](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/covasim-docs/covasim.interventions.html) model as an individual-based model for COVID-19 transmission in the population. Methodological description of the model can be found in this [medRxiv preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097469v1) with application to the UK recently published at [the Lancet Child & Adolescent Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30250-9/fulltext). Applications of Covasim to other settings are ongoing. 
- Lead by collaborators at Univerity of Edinburgh, we also develoed a rule-based modelling framework that generalises reaction-based models with reagents with internal state that may be bound together to form complexes, as in chemistry. The methodological paper is under review at Journal of Infectious Disease Modelling with a [preprint here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12077)
- We are also organising a [Virtual forum for knowledge-exchange in mathematical sciences](vfkems.md)
