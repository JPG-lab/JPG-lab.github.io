## Introduction

I am a Senior Research Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematical modelling at University College London, and a Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at The Queen's College, Oxford University. I also hold an honorary Lectureship position at the Department of Mathematics and at CoMPLEX at UCL and the Wolfson Centre of Mathematical Biology at Oxford University and an honorary Academic Researcher post at Public Health England (PHE).

My research uses mathematics and statistics to answer existing and emerging health questions. 
 
I have over eight years experience of modelling infectious diseases. I am currently actively leading various projects on modelling COVID-19 transmission across different settings to inform decision making. I work closely with researchers at Public Health England, and advise the UK Department of Health and Social Care, the World Bank, the Gates Foundation and FIND working across different projects.

## COVID-19 research work

Since the onset of the pandemic, I have actively been leading a portfolio of COVID-19 modelling work, collaborating accross instititions and countries.

My current COVID-19 projects include:

- Covasim model: Together with collaborators at the [Institute for Disease Modelling](https://idmod.org/tools) we developed the [Covasim](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/covasim-docs/covasim.interventions.html) model as an individual-based model for COVID-19 transmission in the population. Methodological description of the model can be found in this [medRxiv preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097469v1). The model was applied to the UK to explore different strategies to reopen schools with the work recently published at [the Lancet Child & Adolescent Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30250-9/fulltext) and widely quoted in the [media](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/headlines/2020/aug/testing-and-tracing-must-be-scaled-prevent-second-covid-19-wave). An extension of this work that evaluates the impact of combining face coverings and different test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategies has recently been submitted for publication, with preprint available soon. Applications of Covasim across a number of other settings are also ongoing. 
- SEIR-TTI model: Working with collaborators, we extended the classic SEIR model to incorporate probabilistic framework to in details model contact tracing. The new SEIR-TTI model allows different TTI strategies to be explored. The methodological paper is currently under review at PLoS Comp Biol with a preprint available [here](https://covidtti.com/). 
- Epi-Economic modelling: The SEIR-TTI model was combined with economic analysis and a user-friendly [interface](https://ptti.styx.org) to explore patterns of infections and economic costs of different NPIs to reduce coronavirus transmission. Preprint of the ongoing work is available [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3627273). 
- Rule-Based-Model (RBM): Lead by collaborators at Univerity of Edinburgh, we also developed a rule-based modelling framework that generalises reaction-based models with reagents with internal state that may be bound together to form complexes, as in chemistry. The methodological paper is under review at Journal of Infectious Disease Modelling with a [preprint here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12077). The model is currently being applied across a number of Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) in collaboration with researchers from Imperial College London.
- Social distancing and COVID-19 model: Working with NHS North East London Commissioning Alliance, we developed an SEIR model to explore the level of social distancing necessary to safely reopen socialty following the nationwide lockdown. The written up work is under review with a preprint available [here](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-68209/v1). 
- Determining the cohorts at risk of COVID-19: Working with NHS North East London Commissioning Alliance, we use statistical analysis to untangle the key cohorts at risk of hospitalisation, intensive care admission and deaths associated with COVID-19. The written up work is in the process of submission with a preprint available soon.
- The impact of RT-PCR vs anti-body tests for COVID-19: Working with collaborators at Queen Mary University London and across different institutions in Austria, I am leading statistical analysis to evaluate the effect of primary care testing for COVID-19. Preprint of the work can be found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152439v1).
- Exploring the susceptibility to and transmissibility of COVID-19 accross different age groups: I am involved in work led by Prof Russell Viner that aims to untangle the differences in susceptibility to and transmissibility of COVID-19 in children compared to adults. A preprint of the work recently accepted for publication at JAMA Paediatrics is available [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.20.20108126v2).

## COVID-19 other publications

- I have written a number of commissioned pieces for [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/profiles/jasmina-panovska-griffiths-1013696/articles) and an editorial for [BMC Public Health](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08671-z).
- I have had two commissined opinion pieces at the BMJ discussing [asymptmatic COVID-19 infections](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/05/04/how-much-is-covid-19-spreading-via-asymptomatic-versus-symptomatic-infections/) and how we [balance protecting lives and livelihoods](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/06/01/balancing-lives-and-livelihoods-in-post-covid-19-lockdown/) as lockdown is relaxed.
- I have also been commisioned to write a chapter for the Data Science: Theory and Applications, Volume 44 in the Handbook of Statistics series, that highlights new advances in the field, with [this new volume](https://www.elsevier.com/books/data-science-theory-and-applications/rao/978-0-323-85200-5) presenting interesting chapters on a variety of interesting topics. My chapter will look into current state of modelling the COVID-19 pandemic and give examples if models that my collaborators and I have developed. 

## 2-day workshop on Modelling and COVID-19

- Together with collaborators from University of Edinburgh and University of Warwick, and supported by the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS), I'm organising a [Workshop on mathematical modelling and COVID-19](https://www.icms.org.uk/VMMCovid.php) to discuss how modelling has and continues to inform policy decision making around the UK epidemic.

## Other infectious diseases research work

- Modelling influenza transmission. Recently, together with collaborators at the Department of Mathematics at UCL, PHE and the Department of Health and Social Care in the UK, we published three papers comparing the impact of dfferent vaccine policies against pandemic influenza. The methodology is described in the [Methods X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7139115/) paper, the application to the UK context in [Vaccine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20308057?via%3Dihub) and the net-benefit of these vaccine policies on the last four pandemics in the [JTB](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31059716/). A user-friendly interface we have developed for the purpose of this work can be found [here](https://vaccinparamspaceanalysis.shinyapps.io/shinyPlots/).
- Modelling HIV in UK. Work co-lead by myself and a collaborator at Queen Mary University London applied statistical analysis to evaluate the effect of post-trial nurse-led enhanced primary care testing for HIV. The longitudinal analysis was published in [EClinical Medicine](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/eclinm/PIIS2589-5370(19)30234-2.pdf). The cross-sectional analysis is currently being prepared for publication with a preprint available soon.
- Modelling childhood vaccine-preventable diseases. I recently led work funded by the Department of Health and Social Care, and working with Prof Martin Utley within UCL, to develop a novel formal method to evaluate the impact of vaccination changes to one aspect of the programme across an entire vaccine programme. The study was publlished in [Vaccine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30055970/)
- Optima Model. Since 2015 I am part of the [Optima Consortium for Decision Science](http://optimamodel.com) working accross different models to determine how to optimally allocate resources to minimise burden accross a number of diseases and settings. Recent publication from the group on the HIV model can be found [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29652100/), with papers showcasing HIV [TB](http://optimamodel.com/tb/) and [HIPtool](http://hiptool.org)  curently in submission. 
- Modelling HIV across West Africa. I lead a group across UCL, LSHTM and Coventry University that aims to determine the key determinants of risk accross different West Africa settings. We recently developed a [novel mathematical model](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008839v1.full.pdf) that explores the role of different populations cohorts in gearing up the HIV epidemic which is currently in submission for publication.
