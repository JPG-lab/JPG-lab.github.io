## Introduction

I am a Senior Research Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematical modelling at University College London, and a Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at The Queen's College, Oxford University. I also hold an honorary Lectureship position at the Department of Mathematics and at CoMPLEX at UCL and the Wolfson Centre of Mathematical Biology at Oxford University and an honorary Academic Researcher post at Public Health England (PHE).

My research uses mathematics and statistics to answer existing and emerging health questions. 
 
I have over eight years experience of modelling infectious diseases and I am currently actively leading modelling different COVID-19 transmission projects across different settings to inform decision making. I work closely with researchers at Public Health England, and advise the UK Department of Health and Social Care and the World Bank working across different projects.

## COVID-19 research work

Since the onset of the pandemic, I have actively been leading a portfolio of COVID-19 modelling work, collaborating accross instititions and countries.

Currently ongoing COVID-19 prject include:

- Together with collaborators at the [Institute for Disease Modelling](https://idmod.org/tools) we developed the [Covasim](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/covasim-docs/covasim.interventions.html) model as an individual-based model for COVID-19 transmission in the population. Methodological description of the model can be found in this [medRxiv preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097469v1) with application to the UK recently published at [the Lancet Child & Adolescent Health](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30250-9/fulltext). Applications of Covasim to other settings are ongoing. 
- We have extended the classic SEIR model to incorporate probailistic framework to in details model contact tracing. The new model SEIR-TTI allows different test-trace-isolate strategies to be explored. The methodological paper is currently under review at PLoS Comp Biol with a preprint availble here [PTTI Model](https://covidtti.com/) 
- Lead by collaborators at Univerity of Edinburgh, we also develoed a rule-based modelling framework that generalises reaction-based models with reagents with internal state that may be bound together to form complexes, as in chemistry. The methodological paper is under review at Journal of Infectious Disease Modelling with a [preprint here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12077)
- Working with NHS North East London Commissioning Alliance, we developed an SEIR model to explore the level of social distancing necessary to safely reopen socialty following the nationwide lockdown. The written up work is under review with a preprint available here. 
- Working with NHS North East London Commissioning Alliance, we use statistical analysis to untangle the key cohorts at risk of hospitalisation, intensive care admission and deaths associated with COVID-19. The written up work is in the process of submission with a preprint available here.
- Working with collaborators at Queen Mary University London and accross different institutions in Austria, I am leading statistical analysis to evaluate the effect of primary care testing for COVID-19. Preprint of the work can be found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152439v1)

## 2-day workshop on Modelling and COVID-19

- We are also organising a [Virtual forum for knowledge-exchange in mathematical sciences](vfkems.md)

## Other infectious diseases research work

- Modelling influenza transmission. Two recent methodological papers one publsihed at [Methods X](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7139115/), one at [Vaccine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20308057?via%3Dihub) and one at [JTB](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31059716/)
- Modelling RSV transmission and vaccination. Preprint of the modelling work by my PhD student and co-lead by me can be found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009977v4)
- Modelling HIV accross different settings. Work co-lead by myself and a collaborator at Queen Mary University London applied statistical analysis to evaluate the effect of post-trial nurse-led enhanced primary care testing for HIV. The work was published in [EClinical Medicine](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/eclinm/PIIS2589-5370(19)30234-2.pdf).
- Modelling childhood vaccine-preventable diseases. Recent paper can be found [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30055970/)

## Data analytics and machine learning research 

- Statistical analysis to evaluate primary care interventions. A paper lead by myself was recently published at [BMC Health Service Research](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05397-x)
- Application of different machine learning and AI tool to stratify brain gliomas by grade and mutation status. A paper co-lead by myself was recently published at [BMC Medical Informatics and Decision making](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-01163-5)
