Some examples of research:

- We have extended the classic SEIR model to incorporate probailistic framework to in details model contact tracing. The new model SEIR-TTI allows different test-trace-isolate strategies to be explored. The methodological paper is currently under review at PLoS Comp Biol with a preprint availble here [PTTI Model](https://covidtti.com/)
- Together with collaborators at the Institute for Disease Modelling
- We also do some [Rule-based modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12077)
- We are also organising a [Virtual forum for knowledge-exchange in mathematical sciences](vfkems.md)
